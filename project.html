<!--- OVERVIEW --->
<h5 class="highlight"> Overview </h5>
<p>There are many storage applications out there, yet so many are the equivalent of an empty white room. Whether people just need a place to keep old files or balance various projects at once, as a designer, I wanted to help create an experience that was less of a blank box and more like a Google playground workplace. Despite a rough start and lengthy turnaround time, I learned a lot about about how to design better and how to think like a better designer.</p>
</br>
<h5 class="highlight"> Problem </h5>
<p>The client had a very generic idea for a cloud storage/organization app to target the needs of a particular audience. Not only in upholding the expected features of a storage app such as saving/creating content, organizing, and uploading files, but also to incorporate a more social aspect to the app to generate growth via ‘network effect’.</p>
</br>
<h5 class="highlight" > Solution </h5>
<p>To create something different without reinventing the wheel, I needed to accurately articulate the specific brand persona as well as build fluid usability in order to separate the Verre app from top competitors. To develop something that can compete with current cloud storage applications, I focused on unique branding that also tied in with addressing the user’s needs . In branding I focused on three aspects: <span class="bold">transparency, boldness,</span> and <span class="bold">fun.<span> </p>

<!--- DISCOVERY --->
<div class="divider">
  <center><h5 class="highlight">DISCOVERY</h5></center></br>
  <p>When first solving this design problem, I first had to understand the industry and what users expect.</p>
</div>

      <!--- USER SURVEY --->
      <section>
        <center><h5>User Survey </center>
          <p>I needed to find the alignment between what precedents are doing and what users needs. Also, if those needs are not met, knowing how and why will help dictate specific design decisions down the line. Though a lot of good information came from the user survey, there were a few specific findings that had more influence on the overall design than others.</p>

          <ul class="container questions">
            <li><span>What is the main reason you use cloud storage?</span></li>
            <li><span>How often do you edit others’ files?</span></li>
            <li><span>Out of all the features, which is the most important to you?</span></li>
            <li><span>About how much storage do you currently utilize in total?</span></li>
            <li><span>Which cloud storage application do you use?</span></li>
            <li><span>Have you ever STOPPED using any [of these] cloud storage applications?</span></li>
          </ul>
      </br>
          <div class="stats container">
            <ul class="statblocks">
              <li class="stat">
                <h1 class="bold">61%</h1><br/>
                <p>Value syncing files most</p>

              <h1 class="bold">50%</h1><br/>
                <p>Use 1-10GB</p>
              </li>
              <li class="stat">
                <h1 class="bold">84%</h1><br/>
                <p>Upload primarily Text Documents</p>
              </li>
              <li class="stat">
                <h1 class="bold">73%</h1><br/>
                <p>Use Google Drive</p>
              </li>
              <li class="stat">
                <h1 class="bold">48%</h1><br/>
                <p>Stopped using DropBox</p>
              </li>
              <li class="stat">
                <h1 class="bold">10%</h1><br/>
                <p>Edit others' files</p>
              </li>
          </div>
          </br>
          <p class="container">The most important finding from these statistics is that most users DO NOT collaborate or share files. This is a vital point due to the client asking to incorporate these aspects to generate a ‘network effect’. Another interesting find was that many users ceased their usage of DropBox. As a result, I paid closer attention to the ‘cons’ of DropBox to avoid their mistakes. In contrast, I saw what Google Drive got right as a basis to help develop ideas that would make Verre standout.</p>

              <p>Diligent in both his academics and personal interests, Jim makes the most of his day by taking advantage of the simplicity and ease of the internet. With cloud storage, he is able to write essays on the go and upload photos almost as soon as he takes them. No matter where he is, he will find photos to take, averaging to hundreds of photos every single day.</p>

              <ul>

        </div>
        </center>
        <p>	During the competitive analysis I paid close attention to branding and user feedback. By comparing the various pros/cons of competition as well as committing a SWOT analysis  I found ways to capitalize on their shortcomings to better serve people. For instance, users favor ease of use and synchronization, while disliking inconsistent (and pricey) plans.</p>

      <p>I start off initially with some sketching to put down some general ideas that come to mind. Afterwards, I brainstorm a word list to have a target to filter those sketches through. Finally, I do some mind-mapping where I connect the different thoughts to help steer towards both the brand name and logo. </p>
